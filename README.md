# TOP Project: Library

## What Is It?

This is a simple app that allows a user to input book information which is then stored locally. All stored book are then displayed to the user using a table. Only the browser's local storage is used. There is no database.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- [Bulma CSS Framework](https://bulma.io/)
- JavaScript

## Learning Objectives

This project is from the JavaScript section of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com). The main objectives of this activity were to implement a constructor function that creates book objects and to attach a function to the book object's prototype.

## Quirks, Oddities, Known Bugs, Etc.

- There is almost no error handling or data validation to speak of. I'm certain you could easily break this app if you tried.
- This app relies on your browser's local storage, so data is no preserved accross different browsers or machines.
- There is no user authentication and the app is not connected to a database (see above.)
- The styling is pretty basic.

## Misc.

User assumes all responsibility, and will not hold the author liable, in the the extremely unlikely occurrence that this app somehow negatively affects your browser, computer hardware, etcetera, etcetera...
